# Why need to learn Machine Learning ?
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64508435/109885685-e8b67e00-7cb9-11eb-9d62-40fe7f1ff66a.png" height="350px"/>

- **Spread Sheets (Excel, CSV)**: store data that business needs → Human can analyse data to make business decision
- **Relational DB (MySQL)**: a better way to organize things → Human can analyse data to make business decision
- **Big Data (NoSQL)**: FB, Amazon, Twitter accumulating more and more data like "User actions, user purchasing history", where you can store un-structure data → need Machine Learning instead of Human to make business decision

- [A subset of AI](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/): ML uses Algorithms or Computer Programs to learn different patterns of data & then take those algorithms & what it learned to make prediction or classification on similar data.
- The things hard to describe for computers to perform like 
  - How to ask Computers to classify Cat/Dog images, or Product Reviews

### Difference between ML and Normal Algorithms
- Normal Algorithm: a set of instructions on how to accomplish a task: start with `given input + set of instructions` > output
- ML Algorithm    : start with `given input + give output` > output = set of instructions between I/P and O/P

- **Supervised**: Data with Label
- **Unsupervised**: Data without Label like CSV without Column Names
  - *Clustering*: Machine decicdes clusters/groups
  - *Association Rule Learning*: Associate different things to predict what customers might buy in the future
- **Reinforcement**: teach Machine to try and error (with reward and penalty)
