# Why need to learn Machine Learning ?

- **Spread Sheets (Excel, CSV)**: store data that business needs → Human can analyse data to make business decision
- **Relational DB (MySQL)**: a better way to organize things → Human can analyse data to make business decision
- **Big Data (NoSQL)**: FB, Amazon, Twitter accumulating more and more data like "User actions, user purchasing history", where you can store un-structure data → need Machine Learning instead of Human to make business decision

- [A subset of AI](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/): given Machine some inputs, and tell the Machine to learn that input, so that it can give us output when we give it the new input
- The things hard to describe for computers to perform like 
  - How to ask Computers to classify Cat/Dog images, or Product Reviews
- **Supervised**: Data with Label
- **Unsupervised**: Data without Label like CSV without Column Names
  - *Clustering*: Machine decicdes clusters/groups
  - *Association Rule Learning*: Associate different things to predict what customers might buy in the future
- **Reinforcement**: teach Machine to try and error (with reward and penalty)
