# Standard Deviation and Variance
## Variance
```Python
# Varainace = measure of the average degree to which each number is different to the mean
# Higher variance = wider range of numbers
# Lower variance = lower range of numbers
np.var(a2)
```
## Standard Deviation
```Python
# Standard deviation = a measure of how spread out a group of numbers is from the mean
np.std(a2)
# Standar deviation = Square Root of Variance
np.sqrt(np.var(a2))
```
